## Overview

Buttons allow users to trigger an action or event with a single click. For example, you can use a button for allowing the functionality of submitting a form, opening a dialog, canceling an action, or performing a delete operation.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-button--primary" />
</Canvas>



## Button Size

<Canvas>
  <Story 
      id="components-button--primary"
      name="Name JHere"
      args={{ 
        buttonSize: 'small'
      }}>
      {DocsTemplate.bind({})}
  </Story>
  <Story 
      id="components-button--primary"
      name="Name JHere"
      args={{ 
        buttonSize: 'large'
      }}>
      {DocsTemplate.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Primary

<Story id="components-button--primary" />
